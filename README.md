# CodSoft-Internship
I have successfully completed the tasks assigned during my internship as a Web Developer at CodSoft. I hope this will be beneficial for you.

(Level 1)

**Task 1: LANDING PAGE**
A landing page is an ideal web development project for beginners, requiring basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Through this task, you'll learn to create columns, divide sections, arrange items, and incorporate headers and footers. The key aspect is to unleash your creativity to design an impressive page. Focus on alignments, padding, color scheme, boxes, and other elements. Be mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping components. In summary, a landing page project allows you to apply HTML and CSS skills, fostering creativity while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

**Task 2: PORTFOLIO PAGE**
Creating a personal portfolio using CSS and HTML is a popular beginner web development project. 
- **Header Section**: Add your name or a logo at the top. Optionally, include a brief introduction or tagline.
- **About Section**: Insert an image of yourself and write a short bio highlighting your skills and experience.
- **Skills Section**: List your key skills or areas of expertise.
- **Projects Section**: Showcase samples of your work or projects, including project titles, descriptions, and images.
- **Resume Section**: Provide a link to download your resume in PDF format.
- **Contact Section**: Include your contact information, such as email address and phone number.
- **Footer**: Add a copyright notice and any additional links or information.

**Task 3: CALCULATOR**
To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you'll need to implement an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator should have a display screen to show user input and results. Utilize the CSS grid system for button alignments. Use event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops to handle user input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be accomplished with basic knowledge of these technologies.
